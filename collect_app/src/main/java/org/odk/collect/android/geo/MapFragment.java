/**
 * Interface for a Fragment that renders a map view.  The plan is to have one
 * implementation for each map SDK, e.g. GoogleMapFragment, OsmDroidMapFragment, etc.
 *
 * This is intended to be a single map API that provides all functionality needed
 * for the three geo widgets (collecting or editing a point, a trace, or a shape):
 *   - Basic control of the viewport (panning, zooming)
 *   - Displaying and getting the current GPS location
 *   - Requesting a callback on the first GPS location fix
 *   - Requesting callbacks for short clicks and long presses on the map
 *   - Adding editable points to the map
 *   - Adding editable traces (polylines) to the map
 *   - Adding editable shapes (closed polygons) to the map
 *
 * Editable points, traces, and shapes are called "map features" in this API.
 * To keep the API small, features are not exposed as objects; instead, they are
 * identified by integer feature IDs.  To keep the API unified (instead of having
 * three distinct modes), the map always supports all three kinds of features,
 * even though the geo widgets only use one kind of feature at a time.
